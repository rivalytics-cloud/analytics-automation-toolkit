# analytics-automation-toolkit

This script is a template that showcases a typical analytics automation workflow in Python:

Connects to a Teradata database

Exports query results to Excel

Emails the report through the Outlook desktop app (win32com)

Note:
This is a generic example based on automation solutions I’ve built in professional analytics roles.
All variables, queries, and logic are for demonstration only—no proprietary or sensitive information is included.
