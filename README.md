# analytics-automation-toolkit
Templates for data automation scripts I’ve developed as a data analyst. 
These examples demonstrate clean code structure and common workflows like database extraction, report generation, and automated emailing.


📝 About teradata_to_excel_outlook.py
This template showcases a typical analytics automation workflow in Python:

- Connects to a Teradata database

- Exports query results to Excel

- Emails the report through the Outlook desktop app (win32com)

Note:
This is a generic example based on automation solutions I’ve built in professional analytics roles.
All variables, queries, and logic are for demonstration only—no proprietary or sensitive information is included.
